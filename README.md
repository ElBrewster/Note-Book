Digital-Notes-Thing

Just Another Digital-Notes-Thing

I was about to sit down to do a refresher course on TypeScript when I realized I could no longer stand any of my notetaking options. I say this as somebody standing in front of a wall of journals & art supplies, and standing before two screens open to my Chrome browser, with notepad, Notion, Notes, TextEdit, Signal and Slack full of unorganized stuff. I figured it would be faster to spin-up a small Remix.js app than to go learn a new note-taking interface and its customizations. Then I can have a database and I can filter and make it purple. Or something.

So I'm leaving this here in case you'd like to personalize your own full-stack note-taking experience.
